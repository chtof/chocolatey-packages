    <description><![CDATA[## Features

### One application for all your settings
Engine was designed to have a low impact on your gaming rig while handling all of your important gaming settings.

### Automatic game configurations
User configurations like the [Rival 710's](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-710) OLED display can change based on which game you're playing.

### Illumination, macros, binds and more
Customize illumination settings on your [Arctis 5](), or set up advanced macros and binds for your [Apex M750](https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-m750) or [Apex M750 TKL](https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-m750-tkl) keyboard.

### Tactile alerts
Use Engine to customize the vibration patterns, duration, intensity, and triggers for your [Rival 500](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-500) or [Rival 710](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-710).

### Settings across platforms
SteelSeries CloudSync lets you backup, share and sync your settings across all your platforms. Create a SteelSeries ID, login, and send your data to the cloud.
