    <description><![CDATA[[BusyBox](http://busybox.net) is a single binary that contains many common Unix tools. It's often found in embedded Linux systems like routers, in Android smartphones, in Linux containers and anywhere else it would be handy to have a compact set of Unix command line tools.
busybox-w32 is a port of BusyBox to the Microsoft Windows WIN32 API. It brings a subset of the functionality of BusyBox to Windows in a single self-contained native executable.

This version of BusyBox implements well over a hundred Unix-style commands. Some of the more significant are:
- ash
The BusyBox shell is based on ash. It strives to be POSIX-compatible, though it does support some features of bash. A UNIX-style shell is something like the Windows command prompt, though much more powerful. It can be used as an interactive command line or to run shell scripts (like Windows batch files, though again, much more powerful).
- awk
awk is a scripting language with a particular emphasis on pattern matching. It's commonly used to process text files containing rows and columns of data.
- sed
sed is a stream editor. It can be used to make automatic, non-interactive changes to text files.
- vi
vi is a powerful visual editor. If you're already familiar with vi you'll know what to expect. If not you should be aware that it's not particularly intuitive: you need to learn how to use vi. Try this BusyBox vi tutorial.
Other staples of Unix shell programming, such as find and grep are also available. Most of the commands have a --help option that displays a brief description and documents the available options.
