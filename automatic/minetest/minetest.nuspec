    <description><![CDATA[An open source voxel game engine. Play one of our many games, mod a game to your liking, make your own game, or play on a multiplayer server.

## Features
### Players
#### Choose from Multiple Games
There are many games to choose from. You could survive in a harsh environment, build creatively, or fight other players. Just download a game or connect to a server.

#### Enormous Maps
With 62,000 × 62,000 × 62,000 blocks, there’s no running out of space. You can mine 31,000 blocks down, or build 31,000 blocks up.

#### Multiplayer Support
Play by yourself, locally with your friends, or online with dozens of players on a server.

#### Texture Packs
Not happy with the look of the textures? Change them!

#### Beautiful Map Generators
Choose from many different fast map generators included in the engine, or install one as a mod.

### Developers
Make a Game
Create your own voxel game using our Lua API. No need to worry about tricky voxel rendering or networking; instead, write scripts to add items and control game play.

#### Modding API
Use the same Lua API to make mods for any Minetest-based game. Publish your mods on the forums, and contribute to others’ mods.

#### Large Collection of Existing Mods
There are over 1,000 open source mods on our forums which are ready to be used, adapted or learned from.

#### Friendly Community
You can find help with any problems on our forums or IRC channels.

#### Open Source
The engine is open source and transparently developed. Submit an issue for anything you’re missing, or get the source code and dig into it yourself.
