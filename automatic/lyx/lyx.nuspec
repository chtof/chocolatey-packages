    <description><![CDATA[LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based on the structure of your documents ([WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM)) and not simply their appearance ([WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)).

LyX combines the power and flexibility of [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)/[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) with the ease of use of a graphical interface. This results in world-class support for creation of mathematical content (via a fully integrated equation editor) and structured documents like academic articles, theses, and books. In addition, staples of scientific authoring such as reference list and index creation come standard. But you can also use LyX to create a letter or a novel or a theatre play or film script. A broad array of ready, well-designed document layouts are built in.

LyX is for people who want their writing to look great, right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting details, “finger painting” font attributes or futzing around with page boundaries. You just write. On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output — or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced — looks like nothing else.

LyX is released under a [Free Software/Open Source license](https://www.lyx.org/License), runs on Linux/Unix, Windows, and Mac OS X, and is available in [several languages](https://www.lyx.org/I18n).
