    <summary>Change folder color and get organized.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[Introducing the 2nd iteration of our critically-acclaimed Folder Colorizer. Originally introduced in 2011. The innovation in Folder Colorizer was its straightforward user experience – ability to change folder colour in 1-click, as if it’s pre-built into the system. Now this seems obvious, but in 2011 it was first of its kind. This tiny detail drew extreme attention & organic popularity to the product. Today, it’s reaching 5 million downloads.
All of this makes Folder Colorizer 2 a perfect way to organize your workflow. Easily label your important folders, improve your navigation & boost your productivity. It’s free!
We’re proud that the original concept & design of Folder Colorizer 2 is setting a new bar for the entire category of compact Windows Utility Software.
## The Result
Your boringly-yellow default Windows folders become colorful & fun. Now you can choose from millions of colors. And your folders will suddenly look like these:
