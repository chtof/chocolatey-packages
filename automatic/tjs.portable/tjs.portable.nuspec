      Starting January 25, 2024, JaspersoftⓇ will no longer offer [JasperReportsⓇ Server community edition](https://community.jaspersoft.com/downloads/community-edition) as part of its free downloads. If you would like to try JasperReports Server to embed or distribute reports and dashboards, as well as access other advanced features, you can take a 30-day trial to the Jaspersoft commercial edition.

      The new free Jaspersoft community edition will include JasperReports Library and Jaspersoft Studio, with a one-time required login after downloading Jaspersoft Studio.

      Please visit [their FAQs](https://community.jaspersoft.com/knowledgebase/faq/faqs-on-community-edition-changes-effective-january-25-2024-r4629/) for more information, or if you have any questions, you can send a message through their Contact Us link at the bottom of [their community website page](https://community.jaspersoft.com/).
