It has been tested on all Windows operating systems from Windows Vista to the latest version  available. Log4Om runs on Window Tablets with its full features and can be executed from a memory stick, it’s installation doesn’t use system registry to store information. Windows XP SP3 support terminated with release 1.32.1
