    <summary>Records what you do so that you can know how you've spent your time. All in a secure way where you control the data.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[The goal of ActivityWatch is simple: Enable the collection of as much valuable lifedata as possible without compromising user privacy.

We've worked towards this goal by creating a application for safe storage of the data on the users local machine and as well as a set of watchers which record data such as:

Currently active application and the title of its window
Currently active browser tab and it's title and URL
Keyboard and mouse activity, to detect if you are afk or not
It is up to you as user to collect as much as you want, or as little as you want (and we hope some of you will help write watchers so we can collect more).
