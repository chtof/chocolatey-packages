    <description><![CDATA[## What is Moonlight?
Moonlight allows you to play your PC games on almost any device, whether you're in another room or miles away from your gaming rig.

**Moonlight** (formerly Limelight) is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream protocol. We implemented the protocol used by the NVIDIA Shield and wrote a set of 3rd party clients.

You can stream your collection of PC games from your [GameStream-compatible PC](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/games/gamestream) to any supported device and play them remotely. Moonlight is perfect for gaming on the go without sacrificing the graphics and game selection available on PC.

## Features
### Stream at up to 4K resolution
If you can see it on your PC, you can stream it using Moonlight, including your full Windows desktop at 4K 120 FPS with a capable client.

### Support for 120 FPS streaming
Stream at up to 120 FPS using the new Moonlight PC client with the option to disable V-Sync for the lowest possible latency.

### Stream outside your home
You can host from most home networks without having to do any manual configuration or type any IP addresses. Check out the automatic configuration tool in our Setup Guide.

### Multiple platforms
If you have an Android device, iOS device, PC or Mac, Chromebook, PS Vita, or even a Raspberry Pi, you can use Moonlight to stream to it.

### Open source
The code for our Moonlight clients is hosted on GitHub under the GPLv3 license. We welcome contributions and would be happy to help with ports to new platforms.

### Completely free
Moonlight is a project run by the community, not a company. We have no interest in pushing ads, bundled services, paid versions with extra features, or subscriptions.

## Who they are
Moonlight was created by Case Western Reserve University students as a project at the MHacks hackathon in 2013 and further developed at MHacks and HackCWRU in 2014.

Moonlight developers are not accepting monetary donations at this time and currently have no plans to do so. Instead, please direct any donations toward the [Case Western Reserve University Hacker Society](http://hacsoc.org) - the birthplace of Moonlight, Hacker Society is a club for CWRU students of all skill levels and backgrounds to explore computer science outside of school. If you still insist on donating, you [may do so here](https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1526/index.aspx?sid=1526&gid=1&pgid=381). (Choose
