    <summary>Digital logic designer and simulator</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.
It has been originally created by [Dr. Carl Burch](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and actively developed until 2011.
After this date the author focused on other projects, and recently the development has been officially stopped  [(see his message here)](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/retire-note.html).

In the meantime, people from a group of swiss institutes ([Haute École Spécialisée Bernoise](http://www.bfh.ch), [Haute École du paysage, d'ingénierie et d'architecture de Genève](http://hepia.hesge.ch), and [Haute École d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud](http://www.heig-vd.ch)) started developing a version of Logisim that fitted their courses, integrating several tools -- for instance a chronogram, the possibility to test the schematics directly on an electronic board, TCL/TK consoles, ...

The project is currently maintained by the [REDS Institute](http://reds.heig-vd.ch), which is part of the [Haute École d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud](http://www.heig-vd.ch), Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland.

We have decided to release this new Logisim version under the name logisim-evolution, to highlight the large number of changes that occurred in these years, and **we actively seek the contribution of the community**.

## What's new in logisim-evolution
* chronogram -- to see the evolution of signals in your circuit
* electronic board integration -- schematics can now be simulated on real hardware!
* board editor -- to add new electronic boards
* VHDL component -- a new component type whose behavior is specified in VHDL
* TCL/TK console -- interfaces between the circuit and the user
* DIP switches
* RGB LEDs
* large number of bug-fixes
* GUI improvements
* automatic updates
* code refactoring
* ...

## Testing logisim-evolution
As logisim-evolution needs updates (new features and patches) and currently lacks unit tests, the *testing* branch was created.
The goal of this branch is to add new features/patches without affecting the release on branch master.
Users who are willing test new features should checkout the testing branch. The feedback from users is really appreciated as it makes logisim-evolution better. Feel free to use the issue tab to report bugs and suggest features.

Then every semester, the testing branch will be merged in the master for a new release.

## Documentation
[Here](http://reds-data.heig-vd.ch/logisim-evolution/IntroToLogisimEnglish.pdf) you can find a tutorial (French version [here](http://reds-data.heig-vd.ch/logisim-evolution/tutoLogisim.pdf)) that explains some basic usage of Logisim. The electronic card referenced in the tutorial is a small card we use in our laboratories -- you won't be able to buy it in a store -- but the descriptions should be good enough to be used for another generic board.

Another good reference is [this book](http://www.lulu.com/shop/george-self/exploring-digital-logic-with-logisim-ebook/ebook/product-21118223.html), where basic electronics is explained with the help of Logisim.

## Development
Logisim-evolution uses gradle for project management which means it can be easily imported into most modern IDEs.

Instructions on how to import a gradle project into Eclipse can be found [here](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2018/february/buildship.php).

Instructions on how to import a gradle project into IntelliJ IDEA can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html) under "Importing a project from a Gradle model" title.
