**For what! Prevent system shutdown, Standby, Hibernate, Turn Off and Restart?**

You can also manually customize the window **power saving features** or disable all the options and then reactivate them again, but you can save the time when use  Don't Sleep. Don't Sleep can also serve as a general protection if you have started a background service or application and want to prevent turn off of the computer by itself, or other persons ergo accounts. 

Don't Sleep has a timer that allows you to disable blocking with a timed manner, or to shut down the computer at a certain time. This is a practical function that prevents the PC to running unnecessarily, since not every PC is equipped with a quality power supply that consumes 1Watt in standby mode.

### How does the program work? 

Depending on the setting, Don't Sleep reports to the operating system that it has very important tasks to do if the screen saver is to be activated or the monitor is to be deactivated. Likewise, it notifies the system that it has the highest shutdown priority to prevent other programs from receiving the shutdown command before Don't
